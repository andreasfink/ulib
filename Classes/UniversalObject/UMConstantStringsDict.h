/*
 	the purpose of this class is to collect a bunch of constant
 	strings into a dictionary to be used as cpointers.
 	This means you can only append a NSString and get cpointers
 	out of it which will never been deallocated.

 	This way a c pointer can be used throught the code pointing to this
 	constant string and we are sure the cstring never is deallocated.
