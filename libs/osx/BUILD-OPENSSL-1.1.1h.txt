# You should build openssl 1.1.1g under MacOS X as following

1. unpack the tar apply, the patch and change the directory

wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1h.tar.gz

patch the follwoing files

crypto/bio/bss_dgram.c
test/handshake_helper.c

and replace 

#include <netinet/sctp.h>

with


#ifdef __APPLE__
#include "/Library/Application Support/FinkTelecomServices/frameworks/sctp.framework/Versions/A/Headers/sctp.h"
#else
#include <netinet/sctp.h>
#endif



2. Configure and build openssl with SCTP support

export CFLAGS=-mmacosx-version-min=10.8
./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc sctp no-shared


3. install it into the binary directory and to the system

make install
make DESTDIR=../openssl-1.1.h-binary  install




# to build under AppleSilicon:


add the following into Configuration/10-main.conf

a


    "darwin64-arm64-cc" => {
        inherit_from     => [ "darwin-common" ],
        CFLAGS           => add("-Wall"),
        cflags           => add("-arch arm64"),
        lib_cppflags     => add("-DL_ENDIAN"),
        bn_ops           => "SIXTY_FOUR_BIT_LONG",
        perlasm_scheme   => "ios64",
    },
    
and then compile like this


export CFLAGS=-mmacosx-version-min=11.0
./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc no-shared


Note: sctp is not supported under MacOS  11.0 yet so we cant build with it.
Also asm optimisation is not enabled yet (which I leave to add later)
