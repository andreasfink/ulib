# You should build openssl 3.1 under MacOS X as following

1. checkout the repository

git clone git://git.openssl.org/openssl.git


2. Configure and build openssl

cd openssl
./Configure
make
sudo make install

the PKG has been built this way on ARM64 and Intel X86_&4 architectures
and then the binary "openssl" and the static libraries have been combined with lipo.
the dynamic libraries have been removed on purpose so linking will occur statically only.
