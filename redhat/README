Notes for REDHAT RHEL6
----------------------

RHEL6 doesnt come with the header files for libpcap and libavahi so I had to copy them over. They are in glue.tar.gz
Also some library files do not exist as library.so but only as library.so.1 or the like. so the glue.tar.gz does create symlinks.
sctp.h is in /usr/include/linux instead of /usr/include/netinet so a symlink sets it correctly

to unpack and copy into the / directory do:

tar -xvzf glue.tar.gz
cd glue
find . -print | cpio -pdmuv /
cd ..


Also you need to edit /etc/ld.so.conf

to include

/usr/lib64
/usr/local/lib

and dont forget to run 

ldconfig

after building a library

also set

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/share/pkgconfig/

somewhere in your profile so the packages are found with pkg-config.
